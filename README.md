UO CIT 281 - Project 3

# Project:
Project 3 focused on server communication and JSON. This was our first project where we built a server using Node.js. Our server imported functions to be run when a request was made to a specific route. This built off of our previous project where we learned how to export and import functions. Finally, we added an HTML page that interacted with our server.

# Lab 3: 
In Lab 3, we focused on refactoring JS code into a more modern form. We also practiced object destructuring and console JSON output. This was also the first lab where we practiced exporting functions to be used in another file. This lab really focused on manipulating data.

# Lab 4: 
In Lab 4, we practice initlializing a Node.js server. We did this by using the inline command 'npm init'. We also practiced installing express to help us build our server. This lab also touched on dealing with error, specifically a MIME error. We were seeing issues with a linked HTML file being returned to the browser as text, and not HTML. We also added routes with query parameters.
